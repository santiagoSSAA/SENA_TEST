# SENA_TEST Project General Checklist

This checklist helps you track progress and ensure all checkpoints from the PRD, architecture, and UML documentation are covered. Mark each item as you complete it.

## 1. Project Structure
- [x] `src/` folder exists with modular subfolders (api, core, db, services, utils)
- [x] `tests/` folder exists with unit and integration tests
- [x] `uml/` folder contains all required diagrams
- [x] `docs/` folder contains all required documentation

## 2. Core Functionalities (from PRD)
- [x] Product management (CRUD)
- [x] Sales management (CRUD, sales flow)
- [x] User management (CRUD, authentication)
- [x] Inventory management (including multi-warehouse)
- [x] Report and analytics generation (with filtering/export)
- [x] Invoice generation (tied to sales)
- [x] Notification system (for alerts, receipts, invoices)

## 3. Architecture & Code Quality
- [x] Monolithic but modular backend (as per architecture.md)
- [x] Database models for all core entities
- [x] Transaction history logging for analytics
- [x] Code follows coding_rules.md
- [x] All endpoints documented

## 4. UML Diagrams
- [x] Use case diagrams for all main modules
- [x] Sequence diagram for main flows
- [x] Components diagram for system architecture
- [ ] (Optional) Class, activity, deployment diagrams

## 5. Documentation
- [x] README.md with project overview and setup
- [x] Architecture, requirements, and PRD docs complete
- [ ] User, deployment, and developer manuals

## 6. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all services
- [ ] Integration tests for endpoints and database
- [ ] Test coverage report

## 7. Dockerization
- [ ] Dockerfile for backend
- [ ] Docker Compose file (if needed for DB, etc.)
- [ ] Instructions for building and running with Docker

## 8. UI (Optional)
- [ ] Stupidly simple React UI (e.g., create-react-app)
- [ ] UI connects to backend API
- [ ] UI can perform at least one core flow (e.g., login, view products)

## 9. Final Review
- [ ] All checklist items above are complete
- [ ] Manual walkthrough of all main flows
- [ ] All deliverables packaged and ready for delivery

---

**You are finished when:**
- All items above are checked
- All flows work end-to-end (manual test)
- All documentation and diagrams are present
- Docker build and run works
- (Optional) UI is running and connects to backend
