What remains missing or minimal:

No explicit authentication/authorization endpoints (login, permission checks, role management).
No user login endpoint or role/permission management.
No charts/graphics for analytics in the backend (NOT IMPLEMENT; NOT NEEDED).
No explicit alert threshold logic for inventory.
No user-specific notification logic.
Analytics by population/sector is only placeholder.
Some advanced sales flow logic (e.g., invoice trigger on sale) may be placeholder.
