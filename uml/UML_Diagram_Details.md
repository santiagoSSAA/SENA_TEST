# UML Diagram Details

This document outlines the specific details required for each UML diagram in the project. The diagrams will be created using PlantUML.

## 1. Use Case Diagram
- **Actors**:
  - Primary actors interacting with the system.
  - External systems or users.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Key functionalities provided by the system.
- **Relationships**:
  - Associations between actors and use cases.
  - Include relationships such as `<<include>>` and `<<extend>>` where applicable.

## 2. Class Diagram
- **Classes**:
  - Major classes in the system with their attributes and methods.
- **Relationships**:
  - Associations, aggregations, compositions, and inheritance.
  - Multiplicity for associations.
- **Details**:
  - Visibility of attributes and methods (e.g., `+` for public, `-` for private).

## 3. Sequence Diagram
- **Lifelines**:
  - Objects or actors involved in the interaction.
- **Messages**:
  - Method calls and responses between lifelines.
- **Activation Bars**:
  - Represent the time an object is active during the interaction.
- **Focus**:
  - Key interactions for major use cases.

## 4. Activity Diagram
- **Activities**:
  - Steps in the workflow or process.
- **Decisions**:
  - Branching points with conditions.
- **Start/End**:
  - Initial and final states of the process.
- **Swimlanes**:
  - Represent different actors or components involved in the process.

## 5. Deployment Diagram
- **Nodes**:
  - Physical or virtual hardware components.
- **Artifacts**:
  - Software components deployed on the nodes.
- **Relationships**:
  - Connections between nodes and artifacts.
- **Details**:
  - Include all major hardware and software components.

## Notes
- Use PlantUML syntax for all diagrams.
- Ensure diagrams are saved in the `uml/` directory with descriptive filenames (e.g., `use_case_diagram.puml`, `class_diagram.puml`).
- Provide comments in the PlantUML files to explain complex elements.
