# UML Instructions for Project Diagrams

## General Guidelines
1. **Consistency**: Ensure all diagrams follow a consistent style and notation.
2. **Clarity**: Use clear and concise labels for all elements.
3. **Tooling**: Use a UML-compliant tool such as Lucidchart, Draw.io, or PlantUML.

## Required Diagrams

### 1. Use Case Diagram
- **Purpose**: Illustrate the interactions between users (actors) and the system.
- **Elements**:
  - Actors: Represented as stick figures.
  - Use Cases: Represented as ovals.
  - Relationships: Use lines to connect actors to use cases.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Include all primary actors and their interactions.
  - Group related use cases logically.

### 2. Class Diagram
- **Purpose**: Represent the static structure of the system.
- **Elements**:
  - Classes: Represented as rectangles divided into three sections (name, attributes, methods).
  - Relationships: Use lines with appropriate notations (e.g., inheritance, association).
- **Guidelines**:
  - Include all major classes and their relationships.
  - Clearly define attributes and methods.

### 3. Sequence Diagram
- **Purpose**: Show the flow of messages between objects over time.
- **Elements**:
  - Lifelines: Represented as vertical dashed lines.
  - Messages: Represented as arrows between lifelines.
  - Activation Bars: Represented as rectangles on lifelines.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Focus on key interactions for major use cases.
  - Ensure the sequence of messages is logical.

### 4. Activity Diagram
- **Purpose**: Model the workflow of a process.
- **Elements**:
  - Activities: Represented as rounded rectangles.
  - Decisions: Represented as diamonds.
  - Start/End: Represented as filled circles.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Include all major activities and decision points.
  - Use swimlanes to represent different actors or components.

### 5. Deployment Diagram
- **Purpose**: Show the physical deployment of artifacts on nodes.
- **Elements**:
  - Nodes: Represented as 3D boxes.
  - Artifacts: Represented as rectangles.
  - Associations: Represented as lines connecting nodes and artifacts.
- **Guidelines**:
  - Include all major hardware and software components.
  - Clearly define the relationships between nodes.

## Notation Standards
- Use standard UML notation as defined by the OMG (Object Management Group).
- Avoid custom symbols unless absolutely necessary and document them clearly.

## Submission
- Save all diagrams in the `uml/` directory.
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `use_case_diagram.png`, `class_diagram.png`).
- Provide a brief description of each diagram in a separate markdown file if needed.

## Review Process
- Submit diagrams for review to the project lead.
- Incorporate feedback and update diagrams as necessary.
